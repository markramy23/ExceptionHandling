# ExceptionHandling
in The ExceptionHandling folder you will find the src folder which has all the source codes for the classes created
inside it there is a dist folder containing a batch file for the application 
if you run the batch file the program will ask you for the path of the .arxml file you want to provide 
.
.
.
.
for testing there are 3 files provided "NormalCase.arxml" is the normal file from the given sample 
you can copy the path of the file and pasting it in the program make sure the path is right and is not between "  ".
.
.
Exmaple: C:\Users\Mark\OneDrive\Desktop\final test\EmptyFile.arxml
this case will create a new .arxml file in the same path of the original file and same name concatenated with "_mod.arxml"
note: it will also print the data in the .arxml file after sorting which is not required but used for testing
.
.
.
.
The other two files "EmptyFile" and "Wrongformatcase" is for testing the error cases
